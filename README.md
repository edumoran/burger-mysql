# Want a Burger?

This is a full-stack app that was built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This app follows the MVC design pattern by using Node and MySQL to query and route in the app, while Handlebars generates the HTML.

## How it Works

1. Start the server (XAMPP, MAMP, etc).
2. Run the application in your terminal/bash window (...node server.js).
3. Type npm install to get/update the packages.
4. Open the browser and go to localhost:8080
5. Enjoy it (and try to break it!).

## The Features

* Want a Burger? is a restaurant app that lets you input the names of burgers you would like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page with a button to devour it.
* When the user clicks the button, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
